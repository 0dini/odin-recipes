# odin-recipes
HTML recipes website

This is an pure HTML recipes project assigned by the odin project. I will later
update it with CSS too style it. Too complete this project i must have a solid
understanding of fundemental HTML, i need plenty of lists both ordered and
unordered. i will also need too work with diffrent text types. I might also
have a few links too other pages aswell.
