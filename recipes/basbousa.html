    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Basbousa, an Egyptian semolina cake with yogurt is one of the best Egyptian desserts that comes out fairly quick. One bowl, mix and dump kind of recipe, yet is hard to make perfect. Today I am sharing the BEST basbousa recipe that everyone was raving about.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Authentic Egyptian basbousa recipe that is soft and stays soft. A delicious coconut, yogurt and semolina/farina cake that gets sprinkled with nuts and drizzled with syrup to put the final seal of perfection.</p> 
    <br>
    <p>Basbousa/basboosa is a term in the Middle east that refers to a very sweet semolina - sort of- cake. Verbally in Arabic we can call our loved ones "basbousa", I sometimes call my little kid " basbousty" which means my basbousa or like saying my sweet.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Farina</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Yogurt</li>
        <li>Ghee</li>
        <li>Shredded coconut</li>
        <li>Honey</li>
        <li>Baking powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a deep bowl, add farina, sugar, baking powder and coconut flakes if using. Mixing everything well.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Melt ghee and dissolve honey in it. Pour ghee over the dry ingredients and mix well with a spoon until you feel that all farina granules have been well covered with ghee mixture. You'll end up with a well-wet sandy textured mixture. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Now add the yogurt to the mix.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Mix just enough until it disappears in the mixture. Do Not Overmix, if you are afraid you might overmix the ingredients, use your hands.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Brush the baking sheet/pan with tahini and ghee. This is a tip I've got from many cooks, I used to brush mine with melted butter though. Dump in your baasbousa mix.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Spread the farina mixture evenly on the pan pressing down with your fingers.</li>
    </ol>
